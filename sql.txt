I am in charge of pages about academicstaff.

1. One page should list all the academicstaff (showing the id, name, department, address [but not the password or salary!]).
        SELECT id, name, deptid, address
        FROM unidb.academicstaff

2. One page should allow the user to search for staff in a particular department.
        SELECT id, name, deptid
        FROM unidb.academicstaff
        WHERE LOWER(name) LIKE %s
        AND deptid = %s

3. One page should produce a report showing how many staff there are, in each department.
        SELECT deptid, COUNT(id)
        FROM unidb.academicstaff
        GROUP BY deptid

4. One page should allow the user to add a new academicstaff member to the dataset.
        INSERT INTO unidb.academicstaff(id, name, deptid, password, address, salary)
        VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s)
        RETURNING *;

5. Extension page for finding units the staff teaches
        SELECT DISTINCT S.uoscode, S.uosname
        FROM unidb.academicstaff A JOIN unidb.uosoffering U ON(A.id = U.instructorid)
            JOIN unidb.unitofstudy S ON(U.uoscode = S.uoscode)
        WHERE LOWER(name) LIKE %s

6. Extension table: assessment
        DROP TABLE IF EXISTS unidb.assessment;
        CREATE TABLE unidb.assessment (
            uoscode CHAR(8),
            time CHAR(7),
            number INTEGER,
            type VARCHAR(20),
            description VARCHAR(150),
            weight INTEGER,
            due VARCHAR(20),
            PRIMARY KEY(uoscode, time, number)
        );
