# Data-backed Web App

This web app uses Python Flask and a database that can access a small artificial dataset about university study units. 

This web app shows four groups of pages. Each group has different fucntionality. 

For instance, there is a group that has four pages for information about the academicstaff. 
- One page lists all the academicstaff (showing the id, name, department, address).  
- One page allows the user to search for staff in a particular department. 
- One page produces a report showing how many staff there are, in each department.
- One page allows the user to add a new academicstaff member to the dataset.
